This is a large amount of test code for a Cucumber testing framework. The tests cover various aspects of the framework, including:

1. Cucumber Options annotation parsing
2. Plugin management
3. Feature and tag expression handling
4. Runner selection
5. Event bus functionality
6. Support for different file systems (JAR, file, etc.)

The code is written in Java and uses the Cucumber library to create test classes.

Here are some observations about the code:

1. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and invalid input.
2. Many tests use assertions to verify that specific values or behaviors match expected outcomes.
3. Some tests use test methods with descriptive names, which suggests that these tests have been written in an iterative and incremental manner.
4. There are many `assertAll` statements, which seems excessive and may indicate a need for refactoring.

To improve the code, here are some suggestions:

1. **Refactor excessive assertions**: Some `assertAll` statements can be replaced with simpler assertions or even removed if they're not necessary.
2. **Use meaningful test method names**: Test methods like `test_` or `_withInvalidTagExpression` don't provide much context about what the test is checking. Consider using more descriptive names.
3. **Consider a more modular approach**: The tests seem to be tightly coupled to specific classes and methods. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more focused tests that target individual components of the Cucumber framework.
4. **Use parameterized testing**: If multiple test cases share similar setup or teardown logic, consider using parameterized testing (e.g., `@ParameterizedTest`) to reduce duplication.
5. **Add more descriptive comments**: While some comments are present, they're often brief and don't provide much context about what the code is doing.

Overall, while the tests cover a wide range of scenarios, there's room for improvement in terms of test design, naming conventions, and assertion usage.
