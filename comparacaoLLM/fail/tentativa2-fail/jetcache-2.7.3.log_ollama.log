I can help you identify the issues with these test cases. However, I would like to point out that there are no actual test failures or errors in this code snippet. The provided text appears to be a collection of test cases or assertions, but it does not contain any actual test failures.

If you could provide more context or information about what these test cases are supposed to verify, I may be able to assist you further. Are these test cases written for a specific testing framework (e.g., JUnit, TestNG)? Do they have any dependencies or setup that is not shown in this snippet?
