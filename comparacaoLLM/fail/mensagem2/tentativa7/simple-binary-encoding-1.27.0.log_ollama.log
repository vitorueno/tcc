The code provided seems to be a mix of different programming languages and styles. However, I will assume that it is written in Java or a similar language.

There are several issues with the code:

1. Some lines have inconsistent indentation, which can cause confusion.
2. There are many unnecessary comments that start with `//`.
3. The code uses a mix of single quotes and double quotes for string literals. In Java, it's recommended to use only one type for string literals.
4. The code contains many method calls without checking the return values or handling potential exceptions.

To fix these issues, here are some suggestions:

1. Use consistent indentation throughout the code.
2. Remove unnecessary comments that start with `//`.
3. Use a consistent type for string literals (either single quotes or double quotes).
4. Check the return values of method calls and handle potential exceptions.

Here is an example of how the first function could be refactored to address these issues:
```java
public static String formatFunctionName(String name) {
    if (name == null || name.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Function name cannot be empty or null");
    }
    return "decode_" + name.toLowerCase().replace("_", "-").trim();
}
```
This version of the function uses a consistent type for string literals, removes unnecessary comments, and checks for potential exceptions.

Similarly, here is an example of how the second function could be refactored:
```java
public static boolean doesNotContainsCodeWithSinceVersion(List<String> sources, long sinceVersion) {
    if (sinceVersion < 0 || sinceVersion > 100) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid version");
    }
    for (String source : sources) {
        if (source.contains("[Car]" + "(sbeTemplateId=1|sbeSchemaId=1|sbeSchemaVersion=" + sinceVersion + "|sbeBlockLength=62):")) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
This version of the function checks for potential exceptions, uses a consistent type for string literals, and removes unnecessary comments.

Note that these are just examples, and you may need to modify them further to fit your specific use case.
