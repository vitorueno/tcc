This is a Java test class that verifies the functionality of various methods and properties related to data tables. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

**Test Class**

```java
public class DataTablesTest {
    // ...
}
```

**Test Methods**

1. **`testCreateTable()`**: Verifies that creating a table with two columns and three rows works correctly.
	* Creates a `DataTable` object with two columns (`intsOnly` and `intsAndStrings`) and three rows.
	* Asserts that the resulting table has the correct number of columns, rows, and data values.
2. **`testCopyTable()`**: Verifies that copying a table creates an identical copy.
	* Creates a `DataTable` object with two columns (`intsOnly` and `intsAndStrings`) and three rows.
	* Calls the `copy()` method on the original table to create a copy.
	* Asserts that the resulting copy has the same number of columns, rows, and data values as the original table.
3. **`testMetadata()`**: Verifies that metadata information is correctly extracted from a table.
	* Creates a `DataTable` object with two columns (`intsOnly` and `intsAndStrings`) and three rows.
	* Calls the `getMetadata()` method on the table to extract metadata information.
	* Asserts that the resulting metadata contains the correct version, compression type, and data structure information.
4. **`testTableProperties()`**: Verifies that various table properties are correctly set and retrieved.
	* Creates a `DataTable` object with two columns (`intsOnly` and `intsAndStrings`) and three rows.
	* Sets various table properties (e.g., name, row count, column count).
	* Retrieves these properties using corresponding getter methods.
	* Asserts that the resulting values match the expected ones.

**Helper Classes**

1. **`DataTable`**: A class representing a data table with multiple columns and rows.
2. **`Metadata`**: A class containing metadata information about a data table (e.g., version, compression type, structure).
3. **`TableUtils`**: A utility class providing methods for working with tables (e.g., creating, copying, getting metadata).

**Assertions**

The test class uses various assertions to verify the correctness of each method and property being tested. These assertions check things like:

* The number of columns and rows in a table.
* The data values in a table.
* The version and compression type of metadata information.
* The correctness of table properties (e.g., name, row count, column count).

Overall, this test class provides a comprehensive set of tests for the `DataTable` class and its associated utility classes.
